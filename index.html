      <h2>Chapter 20: Notes (XI)</h2>

      <p>
      I had not looked at that thread since I saved it and sent it to myself, back at Spelunk 04!  I was avoiding it.  I was worried that the separation would begin again.  And while I can't say for sure that it the separation should not begin again, I was worried that if it were to occur again, I would not be able to finish my report.</p><p>
      But I have been writing the report -- or rather, pointedly not writing the report -- or, even more precisely, writing not-the-report -- for quite a while now.  And it's become fairly obvious that I'm doing this in order to avoid things like that thread.  But the Cafe is waiting.  I have a duty to do.  The separation has not occurred, and that means I think I am safe for now.</p><p>
      I remember, when I was first starting to write, that I kept telling myself I needed to produce something that could stand up to scrutiny not only from within the Cafe but from without.  Present self as sane, sensitive.  But there is no way to square this circle -- presenting myself as sane and sensitive is incompatible with telling the truth, because in truth, I am not sane and sensitive.  Or at least I was not, at the time.</p><p>
      If only it had been feasible to get Jenny to write the report, and not me -- she might have been able to construct a public face that would not undermine itself, both unflinching and apparently credible.  But I'm different -- unless I flinch, I won't seem credible.  But if I do flinch, I won't be credible.</p><p>
      If only Jenny could have.  Wonderful blameless Jenny.  Or strange but pure Aaron.  If only someone else could, if only it wasn't me, if only.</p><p>
      Present self as sane, sensitive?  No.  Present self as penitent, wretched.  Present self as culpable, loathsome.  Present self as responsible for at least three deaths (let's not kid ourselves here).  Present self as Eris at the feast and the snake in the Garden.</p><p>
      Let's not kid ourselves here.  No matter how much I make myself slick with honeyed words, there is no way to slide out of my misdeed.  I didn't pull the trigger, but I provided the ammunition.  As it were.  I have been blustering about in the hope of building up enough verbiage to somehow overcome the challenge without ever once confronting its core.  I thought I could just somehow present a mundane account . . . a sublunary account of what happened, leaving out the poisoned jewel in the middle.  No more of that, now.  Either the poisoned jewel kills a tyrant or kills an innocent, but I cannot pretend it is not poisoned.  Let the light pour in, and fill me up.</p><p>
      Back up.  Whence this sudden change of heart?</p><p>
      Well you see, dear reader (and I know, now, that you'll exist, reading these very words I'm typing now), I woke up this morning with, as you might expect . . . a hangover.  Cause and effect.  Good old arrangements of matter, doing their thing.  There was light streaming in through my window, the bleak homogeneous light of a bright but overcast morning.  I kept my eyes half-closed, because anything more would exacerbate my headache.</p><p>
      I tried, half-heartedly, to fall asleep again.  Then, at once, after maybe five or ten minutes of that doomed endeavor, I suddenly found my eyes snapping wide open.  It was unwilled and happened before I could realize what I was doing.  The light hurt my eyes, and my cheeks and sinuses pounded.  And yet I immediately found myself completely indifferent to the pain, in a way and with a thoroughness I find difficult to describe to my satisfaction.</p><p class="white">
      I loved the light.  I recognized the light.  It was that same light that had shone over the holy hill over the plain, back at Spelunk 04!  I scrambled out of bed, whisked on a bathrobe, and rushed out the front door, eager to see my old acquaintance in its full splendor.</p><p>
      It was an overcast day like so many others: uniform cloud cover making of the sky an unpainted swath of canvas, a grayish glow suffusing everything terrestrial, fuzzing shadows to the edge of nonexistence.  Beads of last night's rain revealed themselves on rhododendrons rendered in a minimal palette, no leaf in full shadow, just lighter green here and darker there.  The neighbors' red car sported a dully glowing sheen on top, a reflection of the void above.
      End of the line.  Place where there is no darkness.</p><p>
      In this environment I felt a sudden rearrangement of priorities.  <font size="+1">I remembered the separation,</font><font size="+2">and the plain,</font> <font size="+3">and my stint as the avatar of chaos and abandon,</font> <font size="+4">thrysus in one hand and caduceus in the other.</font>  </p><p>I remembered the Cafe, where I felt at home, and I remembered Spelunk 04!, which showed me how much there is to be done for this world which is -- and I have always been right when I have inclined this way -- not a home.  I looked about at the capriciously arranged material, the precise curve of the red car's silhouette (why that curve, out of an infinity of possible curves?), at the leaves of the rhododendron, jutting in numerous directions.</p>
      <div class="iyearned">
      <div class="blocks"> I yearned to rearrange them.</div>  <div class="blocks">I heard the call then, stronger than I have in weeks.</div>  <div class="blocks">And I,</div>  <div class="blocks"> to all observers a young man standing in an inexplicable daze on his porch,</div>  <div class="blocks"> walked over to a rhododendron bush and began to . . .</div> <div class="blocks">put the leaves in place.</div> <div class="blocks">I knew where they should go,</div> <div class="blocks">and there they went, and I saw that it was good.</div> <div class="blocks">  A shiver went down my spine and the hairs all along my arms stood up.</div> <div class="blocks">  I was newly charged.</div></div>
      <p>I broke out laughing.  How must I appear?  What would my parents, my old hometown friends -- now in the military, mostly, executing duties of a very different sort -- make of me, here, moving to laughter -- to tears -- by the positions of rhododendron leaves?</p><p>
      <font size="+4"> <strong>I am not a man.</strong></font></p><p>
      I am a hollow vessel into which the machinery of the world's base substance -- of Mundum -- has poured its nectar.  I am a piece of glassware (as Jenny accidentally put it in that thread -- felicitous typo, fortunate fault!) which, if it is not filled, is nothing.  And I have been filled.</p><p>
      There are two stories running in parallel here.  </p><div class="twobox"><p class="two">One is of the story of strange little man with a cramped little mind, ostentatiously furnished but lacking in basic amenities, who helped lead his strange little friends into a drug-fueled, sleep-deprived riot of bad decisions, a failed party so failed it had a death toll.</p><p class="two">
      Another is the story of a unworthy vessel into whom was poured a spark of something Other.  That spark may be divine or devilish, but without it the vessel is nothing, and knowing nothing else, the vessel embraces it without reservation.</p><p></div>
      I am making a bet.  I am going all in, and betting everything on the chance that the second story is worth choosing.
      Covered in goosebumps from head to toe, I looked up through misty eyes at the blank sky, which, like Mundum, admitted of no variation.  I will not shrink, I said.  I am a great sinner or a great saint, but not neither.  Present my actions to the world and let the world judge.  There are others, Salby hoped -- and he was right.</p><p>
      And here is what I saw at that moment this morning, when I looked up at the sky.  I saw a man, a very old man, walking through the English countryside on a day much like this one, hand in hand with his disciple.  By all sublunary indicators, it is not a happy day: the man has just had a series of grueling final conversations with family members and former friends, who at long last find themselves unable to put up with his increasingly strange ways.  He speaks of old harsh withered things; he has outbursts; he is, in every way, at odds with the world.  And what is more, it is the appointed day, on which his disciple, the one man left who understands, is to die.</p><p>
      But Leonard Salby is happy.  William Chen is happy, too.  They press palm to palm, affectionately.  They run together across the fields.  They skip for sheer joy.  They know they have strayed too far from the world to go back.  They have built towers upon towers of recondite theory and lore, towers few could scale, were they inclined, which no one is.  It has taken many, many years to build their monument.  Many sleepless nights, abuzz with passionate conversation, and many dreary days, filled from sunrise on with the contemplation of minutiae -- will this next keystone in the grand design bear its appointed load? -- and the monotonous clack of the typewriter.</p><p>
      But they have been happy through all of this, and they are happy now.  They labor under burdens not quite matched in texture by any endured anywhere else in the burdensome human world, and yet they can sincerely say to each other: "his yoke is easy and his burden light."  It is back-breaking, soul-breaking work, and yet it is the easiest thing in the world.</p><p>
      When you see the monument you must leave behind, truly see it, it is harder not to build it than to build it, however your back may cry out as you lug stone after stone to the construction site.</p><p>
      I am with these men if I am anything.  I have nothing to hide.  I am a terrible thing, but only because I am a conduit for things above.  I offer no sublunary defense for my actions, and indeed I still shudder before them.  But the heavens, I think, cry out in their favor.  If I am wrong, let me be torn apart.  I will submit gladly to the onslaught.
      So I'm here, now, and I'm not going to lie or hold back, I'm going to tell the story straight.  Before the sky, rhetoric is nothing.  No massaging, no sleight of hand, no political framing, none of that.  This is the report.  And I am going to finish it today.  And I will be judged as I will be judged.
      torgo has informed me that he is in communication with Lugnut, regarding the possibility of communication by phone or otherwise.  Maybe I'm wrong, but maybe, just maybe, the world is waking up.</p><p>
      I am going to start a new thread on the Cafe, and dump all of my notes up to this point.  Nothing to hide.  If you're reading this on the Cafe, expect the rest of the story before the day is over.</p><p>
      And now, to write.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 21: Notes (XII)</h2>

      <p>
      So I'm just telling a story, now -- telling a story to you, yes you, Cafe Chesscourt patron.  One thing after the next.  Where were we?</p><p>
      I had been reading, an hour or so after midnight, and something in me had changed.  Jenny noticed it, and asked me if I was all right.</p><p>
      I think it was at this precise second that the separation began.  It might have been as much as a minute or so afterward.  If so, I don't remember who was reading when it started.</p><p>
      I am not sure how to describe the separation, but I am newly committed to telling the story straight, as straight as possible, and so I will try as hard as I can.</p><p>
      It presented itself all at once, as a composite whole, in a way that is difficult to divide into constituent parts without feeling as though one has done an injustice to the nature of the phenomenon.  But divide I must.</p><p>
      First, imagine an almost indescribably intense awareness of the location of surrounding objects.  It is difficult to say what I mean, because of course one is always, on some level, aware of the arrangements of objects in one's environment.  This awareness, however, is a nebulous and largely unconscious thing, tied up in messy ways with the faculties of vision and proprioception.  As an analogy, consider the difference between your abstract awareness of a room in your dwelling which you are not currently inside and the direct awareness you experience when that room is not actually before your eyes.  When you are not in your bathroom, you nonetheless know (barring extremely unlikely contingencies) that your bathroom exists, and that it has a sink and a toilet and so forth, which have some spatial relationship to one another.  However, these awarenesses do not occupy space in consciousness unless you explicitly call them up.  If asked (say) whether your toilet is to the left or right of your sink, you may call up a ghostly mental sketch of the toilet and sink, and inspect this sketch in search of the answer.  But the sketch only exists for a moment, and when not involved in such a process you do not have a persistent, unavoidable awareness of these objects and their arrangements. </p><p>
      Imagine, likewise, that your ordinary visual/spatial awareness is much like the "ghostly mental sketch" just mentioned.  To some extent, on some level, you are aware that, say, you are sitting in a chair, and that this involves your torso being positioned above the chair.  But, unless there is some special reason to attend to this fact, it does not persist in awareness.  You cannot avoid seeing what is front of you, but you can and do usually avoid "seeing" (as it were) the fact that there is a chair beneath you, or that this chair is about three feet (and not, say, ten feet, or five inches) away from a neighboring desk.  But a hallmark of the separation is that these spatial relations become as pressing and persistent to the conscious mind as vision.  I saw, and kept on seeing, vividly and without reprieve, that I was seated on the floor just so, that Aaron was a certain distance to my left, that a corner of his blanket abutted my left knee, that a flat-screen TV was embedded in the wall behind Jenny a very specific distance away, and so forth.</p><p>
      Now, add to this conception another element: not only are you aware of these arrangements, you are deeply aware of their potential to be different, and the fact that you are capable of changing them, and that other arrangements might be better.  One way of putting it might be that it is a version of the basic "revolutionary urge," focused not on the structure of society but on the material building blocks of which society, and everything else, are ultimately formed.  The revolutionary realizes that the social relations he sees around him are only a tiny blip in a vast space of possible social relations; he realizes the vast, vertigo-inducing arbitrariness of it all, the presence of so many billions of little particulars that could well be different, and perhaps should be.  The revolutionary usually thinks in sweeping terms: forms of government, economic systems.  But imagine a state of mind (and I urge you, stretch your empathy as far as it will go and avoid to the utmost the urge to giggle) in which this same urge applies to every arrangement of matter, regardless of social import. </p><p>
      I was aware that our seating pattern was arbitrary.  I was aware that I might well be on Aaron's left, rather than his right, or in Jenny's place next to Kelsey.  I was aware that the couch could be easily slid into any number of places on the floor.  I was aware that the utensils in the dishrack were organized according to no rational design and could be moved with the littlest effort into any desired configuration.  I was aware that there were food items in the refrigerator, in the shelves, which might be removed or remixed.  I was aware that there was a roll of toilet paper in the upstairs bathroom where Aaron and I had talked, and found it remarkable -- I remember this specifically -- that it was all coiled up, pressed against itself, a great mass of material cooped up in a tiny cylinder.  It could be so many places, strewn across the house, or eaten, stuffed into ears, used to wrap other objects -- but there it was, all of it, on that rack.  A world ripe with potential, waiting for rebirth. </p><p>
      Now, why do I call this feeling "the separation"?  This involves a third aspect (much as I hate to speak of numbered "aspects," since, as I have said, it presented itself as one continuous whole).  This aspect is something like a deeply felt sense (i.e. a sense felt as immediately, persistently etc. as vision and hearing) that the world is divided, or "separated," into an "upper" part and a "lower" part.  This is physically literal but also feels pregnant with metaphorical energies of various sorts.</p><p>
      The "lower" (or, following WC, "sublunary") part of the division comprised me, the other Spelunkers, Marsh's house, and more broadly, the whole of human settlements, clinging to the ground, leaving miles and miles of open air above uninhabited and empty.  (I do not think it possible to convey, to one for whom the separation is not occurring, just how comic this image feels: a sprawling, fearfully thin shell spread across the earth, huddling to the ground, cowed by gravity and defying it only as a stunt, or for the purpose -- as in air travel -- of relocating material from one piece of the shell to another.)</p><p>
      The "higher" (or "celestial") part of the division comprised the atmosphere and the whole of outer space.  Metaphorically -- although in the terms of the separation, which presents itself as a continuous whole, it doesn't feel right to call this "metaphorical" -- the upper realms are a place of necessity rather than arbitrariness.  Rather than a desk here, a couch there, we have the heavens, unbroken and (fundamentally) unchanging.</p><p>
      Once the separation had happened to me, I immediately became convinced of several additional notions:
      (1) There are correct ways to arrange sublunary material, and incorrect ones, and it is important (unimaginably important, with crushing fear associated with the possibility of failure) for me to secure, as far as possible, the correct arrangements.</p><p>
      (2) Producing correct arrangements would in some way produce a sort of "alignment" between the two realms.  At the time, I remember phrasing this to myself (insistently and repetitively) as "the correct arrangement will please the sky."</p><p>
      (3) That producing the correct arrangements would not necessarily ensure worldly gain.  In fact, there was an immediate sense (similar in its vividness and persistence to the "perceptions" previously described) that the "correctly arranged" world might be much more unpleasant than the world I was accustomed to.  This, however, did not seem especially important, relative to the abject, transcendental horror I felt regarding the possibility of "displeasing the sky."
      (4) That I, as a mere human body (thinking in material terms), had very limited powers of rearrangement, and would have to be shrewd if I wanted to have any great effect upon the sublunary arrangement as a whole.  The sheer size of the sublunary world -- cities, suburbs, uninhabited wilds, sprawling steppes, forbidding tundra -- was immediately (vividly, persistently etc.) apparent to me.  I was small; the failures of arrangement were great; I would need to leverage forces bigger than myself.</p><p>
      It was this last point which led me, with a curious sort of cunning and common sense still remaining in me, to concoct a plan.  I reasoned as follows.  The separation appeared to have occurred, in me, as a consequence of either reading The Northern Caves, taking Adderall (two pills, where the others had only taken one), or both.  Reading TNC had not (yet) produced the separation in any of the other Spelunkers.  If the other Spelunkers were, because of psychological differences, unable to experience the separation, then I could not use them (with any efficiency) in the rearrangement project.  But I did not yet know this.  The course of action was obvious: I should cause the other Spelunkers to consume a larger quantity of Adderall, and see whether this, in combination with the reading of TNC, produced the separation in them as well.  If it did, we could build from there, harnessing whatever physical forces the six of us were capable of accessing.</p><p>
      It was clear to me that if I continued to appear visibly distraught, this could only hinder me in my efforts.  Thus, I feigned a return to my normal demeanor, and this seemed to work; Jenny was reassured, and I passed the stack of papers to Aaron without incident (aware as never before of the precise geometries involved in the delicate dance of human hands giving and receiving materials, and of paper listing under the action of gravity and unevenly distributed pressure).  Aaron, as chipper as I'd ever seen him, took up the torch:</p><p>
      "but lodown amungst there was a silent outcry and the shock struck the multitude and no more chants returned.  yet the advancement of our savior, blumissimus all around sprouting out ivy athorn and growing grand whorls of purpled and snottish roses out from the sockets of his symmetrical radiating skull arrangment, the advancement of our redeemer, cleanth yclept, was not hindered by the lowing of the bayed and cowed bussoes, and so readily he sallied with a breaker running off every streaming plindt of his rupt and burr and wept.  under strumth we alfull sumeal seak his beating ninefold hearts and every heart apierce with the plums of spring, ungleate and flemmed, fully sull, so that we go under, forevermore, beneath, meneath, u n em suckin bubbles out of the brine mulperial."
      While Aaron was saying this, I observed, with my newly heightened senses, the rapt attention which every member of the circle paid to his face -- the face of this man who they all so hoped would remain in this benign state until we dispersed -- and through a sequence of easily calculated discrete movements I rearranged local material so that my fingers were inside Kelsey's handbag and her prescription bottle was in my grasp.  No one else noticed.  A trick of rearrangement such as this is trivial, when the separation is in effect.</p><p>
      I decorously waited for Aaron to finish, and then asked if anyone wanted more coffee.  This had already been established as one of my social roles, and indeed everyone's cups were empty.  Everyone wanted a refill, and I went to the kitchen counter.  With my newfound powers of spatial attention it was, once again, merely trivial to convert a succession of pills to fine dust and to mix this dust imperceptibly into the brimming pot of coffee I had earlier prepared.  This I poured and served.
      More soon, Cafe.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 22: Notes (XIII)</h2>

      <p>
      My memories of the following few hours are a Cubist jumble of angles and distances, all invested with grand significances which now elude my retrospective grasp.  I can triangulate, from other memories and from forum evidence, that I must have successfully played my part in the TNC group-read even during this fugue.  At 3:46 AM (apparently) I wrote that Cafe post about capacitors and dwellings.  At some point after that, I must have ended up in Marsh's bedroom, talking to Jenny, because it's there, in medias res, that my memories abruptly become intelligible again:</p><p>
      "So as I said I'm finding Caves [unlike Aaron, Jenny preferred to render the title in speech as 'Caves'] a lot more narratively continuous than I'd originally thought.  Like I just don't really think Aaron's division, the whole thing with 'Tales' and 'Non-Lucid Sections' and all that, is really right?  Or, I mean, it kind of gets at differences that are there, but it's a lot fuzzier than that.  The whole thing feels like a story, don't you think?  I mean I had tried to read it before, but never word by word like we're doing now.  And I also think that maybe reading it out loud helps?  Like it just seems like it makes a lot more sense now than it did before, when I tried to read it by myself.  You know what I mean, Paul?"</p><p>
      "Yeah," I said, not untruthfully.</p><p>
      "I mean think about it -- the Tales have their own characters, right?  W and the exechamp and Cleanth and Clete and Caracalla and Captain Krylov and all those weird distinct version of Tom and Sally and Charles, right?  But those same characters are also in the parts before the Tales.  Like, they aren't written as clearly?  Sure.  But there's a . . . continuity . . . and I'm pretty sure there's an unbroken narrative thread there.  I'm not sure it's the sort of thing that can be figured out the way Aaron wants to do it, with these very specific connections where one character in one section lines up with another character in the next section.  I think it's more . . . intuitive than that?  Like, the characters behave very differently in different sections, to the point that you might be tempted like Aaron to think that they're not actually the same people.  But can't it just be a literary device intended to show that people are more varied than we usually imagine?  Almost as a sort of contrast to Chesscourt, where characters tend to be static even when the setting is very dynamic.  So I mean maybe that contrast is what Salby intended and so the reason it seems so weird in Caves is that he's actually trying to move as far as possible away from static characters and so it ends up with characters so dynamic that we have to stretch ourselves to even see them as people.  Stretch our empathy, I mean.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, is it?"</p><p>
      "No," I said.</p><p>
      I was sitting on Marsh's bed, on top of a plush blanket with a diamond pattern interlacing together several shades of brown.  Jenny was pacing back and forth across the slight span of Marsh's available floor space.  The room was filled with miscellany -- cardboard boxes of assorted shapes, a partially disassembled bicycle, dirty plates, etc. -- and the remaining floor space was a streamlined little corridor connecting the door to the bed.  In this cramped space Jenny did lap after lap, which (I'm telling the whole story, remember) supplied with me with a nicely panoramic view of her pleasantly full, solid but feminine form, and the airborne dynamics of her long brown hair, which fell straight down to the level of her armpits and then at once dispersed into a profusion of pretty curls.</p><p>
      "And if we think that way, it explains the changes in the style too, right?  It's just another way of seeing the characters, the opposite of stasis.  It's like what Joyce was doing in the second half of Ulysses, right?  Where these very ordinary people, these lower-middle-class clerks and so on, they get described in all sorts of styles taken from the high literary canon, which provides a whole range of perspectives on them you wouldn't normally get.  I feel like this isn't actually that unusual a technique, is it?  I guess it also reminds me a bit of Cortázar's Hopscotch, where there are several distinct sets of chapters, and they shed light on each other, and you don't have to read them in order, necessarily.  I feel like there are other examples?  I just can't think of them?"
      She looked at me.  I could not think of other examples.  She had very pretty eyes.  Her gaze was intense.  She knew many things.</p><p>
      There was something twisted in the pit of my stomach, because the I knew that the part of me that wanted Jenny to lie down with me on that bed right there and then was not, in the last analysis, compatible with the part of me that wanted to reshape the whole cosmos.</p><p>
      There was not time now for trysts, for earthy joy.  The world was in my hands, and I might fail it.  I did fancy her, so very much.  But --</p><p>
      "You must not imagine that for beings like you and us there can be laughter. The low men laugh, and we envy them. But for us, the higher ones, there is no laughter, only an unending vigil, purely serious, stretching on into the night."</p><p>
      I took a long sip from the mug of coffee I had placed on Marsh's dresser.  In lieu of an answer from me, Jenny was happy to go on:</p><p>
      "And so I'm really, really happy to be here, reading Caves with you guys, because, I mean, of course it's amazing to meet you guys, but also -- I feel like I'm seeing new things in Caves that I never would have seen if I hadn't done this with you guys.  I could see it becoming my favorite Salby book, even.  Because, you know, what I've always wanted to do in my fics is take Salby's world, which is freaking amazing, and add some psychological depth, which I think we can both agree is kind of lacking.  But maybe Caves shows that Salby could do psychological depth, too.  He might be a deeper, like I mean a richer, author than I'd ever realized.  I feel like I could learn things from Caves.  New things."</p><p>
      Something in me weakened then, and I began to speak in an ill-advised way, which threatened to doom my entire scheme, and in doing so, doom the whole world:</p><p>
      "Jenny, this is really interesting.  I guess while we're here, though, taking a break from the group read, there's something else I want to ask you about.  It's about Aaron, and how he's doing, and also, I guess, about how I'm doing."</p><p>
      "Shoot," Jenny said pleasantly.  She was facing me with that intense glare again.</p><p>
      "Well," I began, "I talked to Aaron earlier, at the start of the night, when he was freaking out, remember?  And I think the thing about William Chen, about him dying, hit Aaron really hard.  He jumped to the conclusion that Salby murdered William Chen, and it seems like that . . . well, it resonated? I guess? with some sort of depression, or something, he was feeling, when he got here.  He sounded almost suicidal for a bit, there.  And he seems all right now, but I'm still worried.  I guess I wanted to let you know.  I want us all to keep an eye on him."</p><p>
      What was I doing?  The world was gravely, hideously disarranged; Aaron did not matter except as an instrument of material rearrangement.  But then, I reflected, happy instruments tend to be more effective, as instruments, than despondent ones.</p><p>
      "Huh, I."  Jenny paused for a moment.  "I picked up on him not being in a good mood, obviously.  But I, wow.  I didn't realize it was that bad.  Man.  Thanks for letting me know.  Because, yeah, I want to keep an eye on him too."  She paused again, and looked at me with a friendly expression.  "We're in this together.  Members of Mission Keep-Aaron-Okay."</p><p>
      I nodded.</p><p>
      "Also," I continued, blithely plunging headlong off some cliff I did not begin to understand, "I don't feel especially like myself tonight, either.  I don't know if you've noticed, but I just feel really . . . weird, in this really intense way.  And I wanted to let you know because, I guess, it might be good for you to keep an eye on me, too."</p><p>
      "I will," Jenny said.  "Thank you for telling me."  She was sincere.  The sky enveloped the world, and Jenny enveloped the sky.  Levels atop levels.</p><p>
      (Jenny, I'm sorry.  You're going to read this after I post it -- later tonight, probably -- and I know you're going to be creeped out by some of these descriptions of you.  I feel like I need to write this stuff because I need to do justice to what I was feeling and thinking at the time; I don't want to hide anything.  As you of course understand, real people have many different sides, some good and some bad.)</p><p>
      "I think," she said then, looking at her watch, "it's time to get back to the living room to start reading again.  Thanks for listening to me ramble, dude."</p><p>
      "No problem."</p><p>
      "Oh, and also, you know what I just realized?  I haven't eaten since I got here.  Like, I never even had dinner.  And yet I'm not hungry.  Isn't that weird?"</p><p>
      "Yeah," I said.  "I'm not hungry either."</p><p>
      "But we should probably eat something, shouldn't we?"  (God it twists my stomach into knots writing this.  But I have to record everything.  Tell the story straight.)</p><p>
      "Let's ask Marsh what's he's got in the kitchen."</p><p>
      "Good plan."</p><p>
      This seems like a good full chunk -- time to post it in my Cafe thread.  Then, onwards, further into the caves.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 23: Notes (XIV)</h2>

      <p>
      Marsh's kitchen was minimally stocked.  There was some milk, and some bread, and some peanut butter.  Probably other things, but those are the ones I remember.  We subsided on these things for a very long time, eventually depleting them entirely.  The peanut butter I remember as an adversary -- it was the chunky kind, and the chunks would get stuck behind my teeth, and for the most parts they distributed themselves in incorrect ways, and when it was someone else's turn to read I spent a great deal of tongue-work attempting, with incomplete success, to correct their arrangement.  I remember wishing there were some more well-behaved foodstuff available, but obtaining more food would necessitate leaving the house, and this seemed steadily more and more ill-advised.  The outside seemed like treacherous territory, infested with abominable beasts and swarming mites, ornate with poisonous vines, the edge of some medieval map.  Stepping across the threshold of Marsh's front door would be tantamount to stepping off a cliff.</p><p>
      The conversation with Jenny recounted in the previous post constituted the last break before a long period with no breaks at all.  It is difficult to fashion any sort of narrative out of this period.  On the sublunary echelon, it consisted of our Spelunking party handing around a stack of paper and reading out loud from it.  Occasionally one of us who was not actively reading would walk to the kitchen and bring back some peanut-buttered toast, water, and/or milk.  Occasionally someone would ask for coffee; unsurprisingly we found that a little bit of coffee went a long way, and there was never a need to brew a new pot.</p><p>
      This is not much of a story, and what was flowing through our minds was not much of a story, either.  Some of you might have hoped that our dedicated exploration would reveal a heretofore unnoticed narrative thread in the so-called "Non-Lucid Section," but nothing of the sort occurred.  I found the content of these many hundreds of pages quite fascinating, but not in the manner of a novel.  The closest analogy I can devise -- which is not very close -- is that it resembled a painting: it seemed to be a coherent depiction of something essentially static.  I felt as though I recognized what I was being shown, much as one "recognizes" the forms in a painting which after all are really just so many brushstrokes.  The individual sentences and pages of the "Non-Lucid Section" were indeed "non-lucid," in the same way that an individual brushstroke does not constitute a picture of anything.  Built up into a larger mass, they evoked something definite.</p><p>
      Salby wrote that TNC was his attempt to portray "the obverse face of Mundum."  In his earliest attempt to articulate the nature of this "obverse face," he referred to it, dramatically and yet obscurely, as "THE WHOLE BLEAK ENDLESS WORLD."  Much less dramatic accounts can be found in the peculiar pseudo-academic treatises written by William Chen, the majority of which can be found in the Salby archives.  (I considered it a higher priority to make digital copies of Salby's journals, but having done so, I have now begun scanning Chen's work, and I should have a digital copy of The Salbian Personality ready within the week.)</p><p>
      Chen's work, although verbose, is ultimately not much more illuminating than Salby's "THE WHOLE BLEAK ENDLESS WORLD."  It is very dry and abstract, almost compulsively so; there is the sense that Chen wanted to thoroughly separate the conceptual essence of Salby's views from the poetic, pyrotechnic, and aphoristic style in which Salby typically chose to express them.  So, for instance (in Formalizing Anti-Formalism), Salby's emotionally forceful term "definite wrongness" is subjected to many pages of dry exegesis, culminating in a somewhat ludicrous tour de force in which Chen describes an apparently unremarkable and innocuous glass of water sitting on his desk and explains at length why, in fact, the glass of water is "definitely wrong" in an essential, immutable way.  Salby's own response to this kind of thing, as evidenced by the journals, was ambivalent -- he clearly admired Chen's (indeed quite astonishing) erudition and industry, and considered Chen a dear friend and kindred spirit, but disagreed quite vehemently with some of his attitudes toward "Mundum" and its nature.</p><p>
      My purpose in making this digression is to clarify that none of the voluminous Salby/Chen material really gives one any clear sense of just what it is that TNC is trying to "depict."  Perhaps this is because it was simply easier to write TNC than to set out in plain language what TNC was going for.  (On the evidence of TNC itself, plain language was very much not up to the task.)  And yet, I feel that TNC does in fact "paint a picture" of some definite thing, and that this thing lines up more or less with the (highly incomplete) characterizations of the "obverse face of Mundum" given by Salby and Chen.</p><p>
      Of course, if Salby and Chen couldn't relate it in plain language, then of course I can't either.  But it has something to do with the separation, something to do with the disarrangement of material, something to do with the sense that the world outside of Marsh's house was a minefield, or a malign Wonderland waiting to chop off my head.  The picture is in some way a picture of "the real world" as we see it every day, but exposed as drastically distorted, "incorrect," unsatisfying, in a recursive way so that each subset is as incorrect as the whole, and each attempt to redress the great wrong comprises a continuous part of the great wrong itself.</p><p>
      According to my calculations, we spent somewhere between 30 and 40 hours in this continuous receptive state, reading and reading.  This must sound ludicrous.  But at the time it seemed quite natural.  I can't be sure how any of the others felt about it, but I watched them, and I think we all had the sense that the longer we had kept reading, the more dangerous (!) it would be to stop reading.  We had found a calm, tranquil waterway when there were storms all around.  We did not dare stray from the course.</p><p>
      This phase ended sometime in the mid-afternoon of Monday, June 28.  We had read continuously through Saturday night, Sunday, Sunday night, and Monday morning.  We had closed the blinds and relied on electric lighting, so that the passage from day to night and night to day was barely perceptible.  (The sudden starts and stops of the air conditioner's drone were, however, quite startling.)  The end was initiated by Marsh, who had begun to read the section, beginning on p. 1554, which we had previously agreed to call "Tale 1":</p><p>
      "TOM: We really ought to do something about it.</p><p>
      SALLY: It?</p><p>
      TOM: That crack in the wall.  The spackle I used isn't doing the job.  Look at it.  You can see the crack again.</p><p>
      SALLY: That I can.</p><p>
      TOM: So you see what I mean.</p><p>
      SALLY: I see that there's a crack in our living room wall, to the right of the big mirror.</p><p>
      TOM: I'm thinking maybe I'll call John and ask him to take a look at it.  John's always done a good professional job.</p><p>
      SALLY: Mm-hmm.</p><p>
      TOM: What?</p><p>
      SALLY: Nothing.</p><p>
      TOM: I just think we ought to get that crack fixed.  It's unsightly.</p><p>
      SALLY: Well, whatever you want.</p><p>
      TOM: Do you want there to be a crack in our wall?</p><p>
      SALLY: Oh, no.  Heavens, no!  Nothing but that!</p><p>
      TOM: Look, what are you so peeved about?</p><p>
      SALLY: Well, there's a crack in our wall, for one thing.</p><p>
      TOM: I know that's not it.</p><p>
      SALLY: You do?  You seem quite peeved by that crack yourself."</p><p>
      After reading this line, Marsh just . . . stopped.  He looked around the circle.  His eyes were a bit bloodshot and his face was shadowed with stubble.  He sighed, paused, and began to speak.</p><p>
      "Look, I have something to say."</p><p>
      None of us moved.  It took a number of seconds for me to realize that this was unlikely to be a line from the text.</p><p>
      "Guys -- Aaron, Paul, Jenny, Kelsey, dad.  I have something to say."</p><p>
      "That's not what it says, is it?" I said.</p><p>
      "No.  I'm talking.  To you."</p><p>
      A wave of nausea swept over me.  Everything had been upended.  Our boat had capsized.  There was no telling what could happen now.</p><p>
      "Can we talk?  To each other?  Is that a thing we're allowed to do?"</p><p>
      He seemed to be addressing me, for some reason.  After a moment, conflict-averse as a result of shock, I replied:</p><p>
      "Go ahead, Marsh."</p><p>
      "Okay.  Uh."  He took a deep breath.  "Look.  I don't know what's been going on here.  I don't know what the fuck was in Kelsey's pills, because I have been tweaking out.  Do you guys realize how long we've been here?  I think it's Monday.  I think it's Monday."</p><p>
      After a pause, Kelsey said quickly and with shame:</p><p>
      "Oh, shit.  I forgot to call my parents."</p><p>
      Marsh rubbed an exasperated hand across his sweat-slick forehead.  "I don't know what is going on here, but this is my house, and I want us all to just stop and take a moment and talk about what we're doing here."</p><p>
      No one said anything.</p><p>
      "Like, are you guys fucking crazy?  We get here, Aaron's having some sort of freak-out, and you" -- he glared at me -- "decide the solution to that is to take drugs, stay up for two nights in a row, and read gibberish until our brains leak out our ears."</p><p>
      "It's not gibberish," Aaron said.</p><p>
      "Oh, really?  I'm sure you think I'm just too dumb to get it, right, 'Err'?"</p><p>
      "I don't think you're dumb," Aaron said limply.  "I just don't think it's gibberish."</p><p>
      "Look," Marsh said, standing up now.  "I know you guys think I'm kinda dumb.  Because I don't come up with 'Hypotheses,' or write fics, or anything.  I'm just some stoner dickwad who thought he was good enough for your fancy little coterie.  And yeah, maybe I know words like 'coterie,' but I'm still some stoner dickwad in the end, right?"</p><p>
      "Marsh, personally -- " Jenny began, but he cut her off.</p><p>
      "But you know what?  There are things I can see that you guys can't.  I can see that this" -- he waved the current TNC stack with his right hand -- "is crap.  You have your theories, and your Hypotheses, and all of this bullshit, and I've been so fucking patient with it, but deep down I think you know that this is just not a good book."</p><p>
      "Could you, maybe, tell us what you don't like about it?" Kelsey offered.</p><p>
      Marsh threw his hands up in the air.  "What I don't like about it?  What is there to like about it?  It's not well-written.  There aren't really characters or a story.  There are all these weird words and misspellings in there, but you can tell they're not in there for any good reason.  He's just putting them there to fuck with you and make you obsess over finding a pattern where there isn't one.  It's meant to make nerds waste time.  That's it.</p><p>
      "Think of all the shit we could be doing right now.  The fun we could be having.  Hell, the books we could be reading, actual, good books, instead of this shit" -- and here he flung the stack of paper against the wall.  It splayed out into a number of overlapping piles on the floor.  We all gasped.</p><p>
      "Marsh, I respect your opinion," Jenny said, "even if I don't personally agree.  Can we maybe just all sit down and talk about this a bit?  I mean, it's interesting stuff, right?  It'd be like a Cafe thread, but here in person."  She smiled.  I envied her resilient, sunny spirit.
      Marsh looked like he was torn between several possible gestures.  He reached forward, as if to grasp something from the assorted stack of paper on the coffee table, but then suddenly lurched backward and returned to his lowest-energy configuartion, seated in his La-Z-Boy (facing the couch, across the table) and 80% of the way to full recline.</p><p>
      "I guess, personally," Jenny began after a moment, "I think there's a lot of interesting character stuff going on in Caves.  More than I had realized before tonight -- uh, I mean, before Spelunk 04!  It's not written in a conventional style, no, but as a writer I feel like there's a lot to admire and learn from there, about how to portray characters from multiple perspectives, and . . . "   She trailed off.</p><p>
      "Really?" Marsh said.  His La-Z-Boyed form and slight smirk were reassuring, a recognizable image of the Marsh we knew and, in one sense or another, loved.  "Which characters do you think are so great?  Tom?  Sally?  Cleanth?"</p><p>
      "Well," said Jenny, and here began a set of agreeable, sublunary exchanges.  I was pleased that Marsh had calmed down, but I still felt a deep unease: after this much immersion in TNC, we were still talking about it on this level?  Where was Mundum?  Where was the separation?  I wanted to speak, but feared to expose myself.  Thankfully, Aaron (Mundum bless Aaron) did my work for me.</p><p>
      "I think," he said, "I'm getting something very different out of this than you guys are.  I don't really see it as a story with characters.  I see it as . . . telling us about a certain way of seeing things."
      He gets it, I thought, and was filled with sudden affection.</p><p>
      "I think I was going about this all wrong, on the Cafe," Aaron said.  "And for a while, that hurt me.  I was looking for a way out of how dark the whole thing was.  Some way to turn the deaths into reincarnations.  To tame the whole thing.  But I don't think I need to do that anymore.  I think it's saying something, and it's saying something dark, but I think it's something I agree with."</p><p>
      I beamed.  Everyone else looked as though they were trying to pretend he hadn't opened his mouth.  I looked over at Ken, who had not spoken at all since we had stopped reading.  He looked lost, empty.
      Marsh glared at Aaron.  "So what is it saying?  Probably something too sophisticated for the plebs like me, huh?"</p><p>
      "No, no," Aaron pleaded, "it's not . . . I don't know how to say it, but I think you can get it, Marsh.  I think we all can.  It has to do with death, and with . . . things being in the wrong place . . . "
      He gets it!  I almost cried out.</p><p>
      "It's really weird how I don't feel tired," Kelsey said.  "Like I don't feel tired at all.  I am kinda hungry, though."</p><p>
      Everyone seemed to relish this distraction from Aaron's morbid rambling.</p><p>
      "We're all out of peanut butter," I said.</p><p>
      "Thank god," Kelsey said.  "I don't think I'm ever going to eat peanut butter again."</p><p>
      "I could go for, like, a burger and fries right now," Jenny said.</p><p>
      "You're in luck," said Marsh.  "There's a diner right up the street.  Dad and I go there all the time.  It's, like, the paradise of grease."</p><p>
      Jenny's face lit up.  She looked like a doubting kid who'd just heard irrefutable proof of Santa Claus' existence.</p><p>
      "Let's fucking do this!" Marsh bellowed.  He was in his element again.  Going to show us around the town.  Have some good earthy (sublunary) fun.  Out of the caves.  No more bullshit.</p><p>
      I have to take a break, here, to prepare myself.  The sun is setting.  I will finish before midnight, Cafe.  Let's fucking do this.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 24: Notes (XV)</h2>

      <p>
      Marsh opened the front door, and I steeled myself.</p><p>
      We walked out into a hot, oppressively humid atmosphere.  I took furtive glances at the plants growing near Marsh's doorstep.  Every organism out here was a potential enemy.  A fly buzzed past my face and I shuddered, imagining the fell geometries it must have been tracing out as it flew, mocking with its motions my whole ambitious doomed project.</p><p>
      We walked along an ordinary residential street.  It was searingly bright all around; I could not imagine how people could tolerate such an environment for any extended period of time.  I was aware of the regularly spaced houses on both sides of me, and the separation provided me with schematic perception of their floor plans and of the location and motion of the flesh capsules inside.  Potential for improved arrangement swarmed in my brain and dizzied me, but I maintained a simulation of composure and made my way along the sidewalk, for all the world like any other pedestrian.</p><p>
      Our ambulatory party had formed a set of three clusters.  Marsh and Ken took the lead, and chatted with one another with what looked like a pleasant demeanor.  I wondered what Ken had made of all of this; something told me that he and his son had gotten up to even weirder mischief together.  Jenny and Kelsey formed the second group.  They seemed to be talking about Kelsey's parents.  Many paces behind them, Aaron and I walked side by side.</p><p>
      "You're seeing it too, aren't you?" Aaron asked.</p><p>
      "Yes," I said.</p><p>
      "I had a vision, or hallucination, while we were reading," Aaron said.</p><p>
      "I see," I said.</p><p>
      "I was on a grassy plain," Aaron said.  "It was evening, I think.  The sky was dark and cloudy, but the sun hadn't set yet.  And Sally, from Chesscourt, was there."</p><p>
      "I see," I said.</p><p>
      "And she told me that everything I'd seen and known throughout my whole life was just grass, on this plain.  But there was also a sky, above.  That there was more."</p><p>
      "That's very true," I said.</p><p>
      "She said that she was going to let me speak in the voice of the sky.  And that people would hear my voice, and tell me that they had heard other voices.  But I had to keep saying, this is the only voice.  Just this one."</p><p>
      "The light of the Solenoid Entity immolates," I said.</p><p>
      We walked in silence.</p><p>
      As Marsh has said, the diner was nearby.  After a single crosswalk and another half-block, we found ourselves before a big ellipse of pink neon enclosing the words "JIM'S."  Underneath, large windows showed us a brightly lit interior full of padded booths, with a big metal aisle housing a grill and the cashier's spot.</p><p>
      Marsh opened the door.  "Jim's!" he called out.  He jumped up and tapped the top of the doorframe before entering.</p><p>
      We coalesced at a salmon-colored booth near the front.  My skin lapped up the air-conditioned atmosphere.  Menus were distributed by a waitress who seemed to have stepped out of a cartoon about the 1950s.  My sense of time was quite elastic and physical space seemed to contain more than the usual number of angles.  Part of me felt like lying my head down on the table and part of me felt like spending the next 24 hours scrutinizing Jim's for material arrangement failures.  I think part of me needed very much to go to the bathroom, but a bigger part of me felt it had transcended such things entirely.  I contained multitudes.  I had been awake for around 60 hours.
      The waitress rematerialized.  I had not looked at the menu.  Jenny jubilantly put in an order for some sort of burger (I believe "the works" were involved), and I sheepishly mumbled that I would have what she was having.</p><p>
      With no apparent prompting, Aaron stood up.  "Excuse me," he said to the waitress, "but may I speak with you for a moment?"</p><p>
      Her visible discomfort was only momentary; her professionalism was admirable.  "Sure, honey," she said.  Aaron walked away from the booth and she followed.  I hoped he wasn't going to get himself into some sort of trouble and get us all kicked out.</p><p>
      "What was that about?" Ken asked.  He was looking at me: appointed interpreter again.</p><p>
      "No idea," I said.</p><p>
      Jenny was telling Kelsey she really ought to call her parents.  Kelsey was pressing the point that they'd totally be able to tell she hadn't gotten enough sleep.  "Just keep the call short," Jenny was telling her.  "Say your meal has arrived."  Kelsey approved of this stratagem and pulled out a cell phone, black and covered with little pink decals of cutesy, miniature demons.</p><p>
      "I just wanted to say," Marsh said out of nowhere, "that I don't have any beef with you about any of this, Paul.  It's been a fucked-up trip, but I think you understand Aaron -- better than I do, anyway -- and I trust you're handling this right.  You're a solid dude, Paul."</p><p>
      One of my many parts felt charmed by this, in an uncomplicated way.  I liked Marsh.  I envisioned hanging out with him under better circumstances.  I was pleased to be a solid dude, something I had never before been in anyone else's estimation.  (Another part of me scrutinized his eyebrows, wondering if the project of rearrangement might necessitate their removal from his face.)</p><p>
      After a span of time I could not for the life of me estimate, a waiter -- not our original waitress -- arrived with our food.  Jenny bit into her burger with relish and I admired her earthy zeal.  Kelsey had ordered some sort of expansive, elaborate salad.  Marsh and Ken, in synch, bit into chicken wings slathered in buffalo sauce.  I stared at the burger and fries before me and felt queasy.  The burger's edges quivered, mirage-like.  (I had been awake for around 60 hours.)  Aaron was still not back, and I was worried.</p><p>
      "Guys?"  I said.  "I'm just going to go check and see how Aaron is doing."  Nods all around.  Jenny gave me a thumbs-up and a conspiratorial, ketchup-lined smile.</p><p>
      With a stalking gait, I made my way through the central aisle of Jim's, taking hopefully inconspicuous glances about for Aaron and the waitress.  They were nowhere to be seen.  Increasingly worried, I slipped behind the cashier and through the double doors into the kitchen, where I was confronted with a whole new panorama of disarranged material.  Several large men in white aprons glanced at me for the briefest moment and then went back to their tasks.</p><p>
      I could hear Aaron's distinctive voice, coming from somewhere towards the far end of the room.  I sidled in that direction.  It became clear that Aaron was speaking from behind a curtain, perhaps separating the kitchen from employee bathrooms.  With terrible, shameful, tragic cowardice, I listened and did not move:</p><p>
      "Cleanth Olead Cleanth Olead Slame Todd."</p><p>
      It was Aaron, all right.  The waitress (presumably?) was making appreciative noises.</p><p>
      "There is to be a great awakening."</p><p>
      "Uh-hmm."</p><p>
      "The command does not vary and is inescapable."</p><p>
      "Y-yep.  I gotcha."</p><p>
      "Your contribution will make Clete sleek with quickening."</p><p>
      I couldn't take any more of this.  I slunk back, across the kitchen, out into the main partition of the restaurant, and back to our table, where exhausted Spelunkers were eating up in preparation for the next journey into the Caves.</p><p>
      "Is Aaron all right?" Kelsey asked.</p><p>
      "Yes," I said, idiotically, unconscionably.</p><p>
      We ate; we talked; all was well.  I managed to get down a few bites of my burger and a new complacency bloomed in my brain; all of a sudden the disarrangement of material did not seem like such an immediately pressing concern.  Aaron returned when the rest of us were done, and we courteously stayed to let him eat his onion rings.  We left Jim's in high spirits, feeling back on earth again, newly ready to fuck Salby up, undaunted terraneans ready for anything the underground could throw at us.</p><p>
      "You all right?" I asked Aaron quietly.</p><p>
      "Nothing's wrong," he said.  He seemed distant, abstracted, but I accepted this answer.
      We had gathered in Marsh's living room, and were ready to tell the story of Tom and Sally's deteriorating marriage, when the phone rang.</p><p>
      Ken padded over to another room to answer it.  From our end, the conversation consisted of a few "yeah"s followed by a few "wow"s and "shit"s.  After returning to the living room, Ken explained:
      "That was my buddy Josh.  He called me to ask if I was watching the news.  Because there was this weird story on about a multiple suicide.  At Jim's.  Three of their employees climbed to the top of the water tower across the street and just jumped off?  And no one knows why?  And Josh knew I went to Jim's all the time, and knew some of the staff there, so he was just thinking, you know, I should know."</p><p>
      "Jesus," Marsh said.  "What a fucking weird coincidence."</p> -->
